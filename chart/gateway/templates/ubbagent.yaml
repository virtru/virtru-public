    # For unit/time metrics, the reporting metric should likely be
    # more granular than the pricing metric, since usage should be
    # reported frequently
    # e.g. metric may be reported in MiBy/min but priced in GiBy/day
    #
    # The reporting metric is recommended to be more granular than
    # the pricing metric. If it is not, a double type is likely
    # needed to provide sufficient precision.

    # The sources section lists metric data sources run by the agent
    # itself - omit it if usage reports for all metrics are reported by
    # the application. The currently supported source is 'heartbeat', which
    # sends a defined value to a metric at a defined interval. In the
    # following example, the heartbeat sends a 60-second value (defined by
    # 'int64Value') through the "instance_time" metric every minute
    # (defined by 'intervalSeconds'); this is assuming that the metric
    # configured in service control has 'seconds' as its unit.
    #
    # IMPORTANT: The unit of the metric is specified in the backend, not here,
    # so care must be taken to ensure that the reported value and the unit match.
    # For example, if the unit is defined to be minutes in the backend, a report
    # value of 60 will mean 60 minutes, which means, for the same configuration,
    # we accidentally inflate the reported usage by 60 times! In this case,
    # where the unit is minute, the correct value should be 1.
    #
    # NOTE: 'intervalSeconds' should not be too short to avoid excessive
    # reporting; it should not be too long to avoid missing events in case of
    # unexpected restarts. The recommended value is 1 minute, or 60 seconds.
